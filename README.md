# Project Overview

## Project Title
**Fast Static Website Deployment with Pulumi**

## Overview
This project demonstrates a fast static website deployment using AWS S3 and CloudFront, orchestrated through Pulumiâ€™s Infrastructure as Code (IaC) platform. The goal is to build a fully automated, globally distributed website hosting solution using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while leveraging Pulumi to streamline the deployment process. The project addresses challenges such as configuring public access for static assets and integrating a CDN for performance and security improvements.

## Motivation
I built this project as part of the Pulumi Deploy and Document Challenge to showcase my cloud engineering skills and demonstrate how modern IaC tools can simplify the deployment process. My focus was on creating a solution that is not only functional and performant, but also well-documented for both technical and non-technical audiences.
