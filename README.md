Project Title
Fast Static Website Deployment with Pulumi

Overview
This project demonstrates a fast static website deployment using AWS S3 and CloudFront, all orchestrated through Pulumiâ€™s Infrastructure as Code (IaC) platform. The goal is to build a fully automated, globally distributed website hosting solution using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while leveraging Pulumi to streamline the deployment process. The project tackles challenges such as configuring public access for static assets and integrating a CDN for improved performance and security.

Motivation
I built this project as part of the Pulumi Deploy and Document Challenge to showcase my cloud engineering skills and demonstrate how modern IaC tools can simplify the deployment process. The focus was on creating a solution that is both functional and performant, while also providing clear documentation for technical and non-technical audiences.
